<h1>Summary</h1>

<div class="text">
	I was born in the Netherlands, raised in Zambia, and went to primary and secondary school in Dordrecht, the Netherlands. I received my Bachelors (Electrical Engineering) and Masters (Embedded Systems) from Eindhoven University of Technology. In April 2014, I successfully defended my PhD thesis at the same university. During my PhD I gained experience through two internships: with the OpenCL compiler group of ARM in Cambridge (UK), and with the cuFFT team of NVIDIA in Santa Clara (CA). After my PhD, I worked as a GPU consultant at the SURFsara supercomputing centre and as a C++ performance engineer for a computer vision and machine learning team at Blippar. Currently, I am part of the autonomous driving team of TomTom.

<h1>Interests and expertise</h1>

<div class="text">
	My main expertise is C++11/14 and GPU programming (CUDA/OpenCL). On top of this, I also have experience with compilers, high-performance computing, computer architecture, performance modelling, computer vision, and machine learning / deep learning.
	<br/><br/>
	My passion lies with the development of beautiful and performant C++11 codes, possibly accelerated by GPUs. Examples are <a href=https://github.com/CNugteren/cltune>CLTune</a>, an OpenCL auto-tuner, and <a href=https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast>CLBlast</a>, an OpenCL BLAS library.
